  <div class="intro-text">
    <p>Iâ€™m a full-stack software engineer with a background in pediatric dentistry. They may seem like very different fields, but both are centered around solving problems and helping people.</p>

    <p>I graduated from Hack Reactorâ€™s immersive software engineering program, where I built multiple full-stack applications using <strong>Python, FastAPI, JavaScript, React, and PostgreSQL</strong>.</p>

    <p>I thrive in collaborative environments, stay calm under pressure, and lead with empathy. Currently, Iâ€™m focused on building scalable applications while exploring how AI can enhance user experience and automate tasks.</p>
